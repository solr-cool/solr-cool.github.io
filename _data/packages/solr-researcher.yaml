description: The AutoComplete (AC) enhances the search experience through suggest-as-you-type and auto-complete functionality built into the search form. As one starts to enter search terms, the module detects a pause in typing and offers a list of suggested searches. One can then easily pick one of the suggestions or continue refining the suggestions by typing in more of the query. For example, if you type "bass" AC might offer suggestions that include "bass fishing" or "bass guitar", and even "sea bass" (note how "bass" is not necessarily the first word)
